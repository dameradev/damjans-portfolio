# My personal portfolio

*I'm particularly proud of the look and feel of my new portfolio*

My previous portfolio which I build as I was first learning to code was using a cms(keystone), and it was using an MVC approach, without any (frontend libary, I didn't know React at the time).

This time around I realised that for a simple website as this one I didn't need no CMS, it was a cheaper and faster approach. 

It's buid using GatsbyJS.

For styling I'm using styled-components.
